 when once function returns something it is removed from the stack 
 when outter function returns a function it is removed from the stack but the inner can still call the inner function
 the lexical scope makes an abject of the variables which is used to make closures which are attached to the function.

 <script>
   function outter() {
      var a=10;
  
      function inner(){
         a++;
        
         console.log(a);
       
      }
      return inner;
   }
   let f1=outer();
   let f2=outer();

   f1();//11
f1();//12
f2();//11
f2();//12
//The closure for every variable will be different(new closure is made)
// it is used in memorisation,debouncy,throthy
//lexical scope ka function bnn ke aata hai
